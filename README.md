# January-Project
 
This is my first project of the Year!
Countrynator is an app based on the country.csv file at it provides the user with any information 
the file contains.

This app is stil in development as I need to merge its pages.

Speaking.py takes in voice input and returns answers to the voiced question in a tkinter window
Typing.py takes questions written as text and returns typed answers in a tkinter window
